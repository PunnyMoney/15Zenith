Informational website to shed light on the cladding scandal at Zenith Close.

### Developed by:
* Penny Jungreis - [GitHub](https://github.com/penelopecj)

## Deployment
I deployed this website using Netlify and it is available [_here_](https://15zenith.co.uk/). 

## Description
Life on hold. Crippling costs. Safety fears. Despite being just six years old, 15 Zenith Close was built with significant defects by its developer Hill Group. Information from freeholder and housing association Notting Hill Genesis has meanwhile been incorrect, confusing, and inconsistent, so this website sets out the real facts of the situation for residents and journalists.
