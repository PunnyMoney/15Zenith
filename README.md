It has also been brought to the attention of MP Matthew Offord and Councilor Anne Clark, who have elevated the matter to Barnet Council and Parliament.

## Description
Despite being just six years old, 15 Zenith Close was built with significant defects by its developer Hill Group. Information from freeholder and housing association Notting Hill Genesis has meanwhile been incorrect, confusing, and inconsistent, so this website sets out the real facts of the situation for residents and journalists.
